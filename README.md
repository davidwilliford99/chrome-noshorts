# No More Youtube Shorts
This extension seeks to end the time-suck known as youtube shorts. Using this extension, you can now browse YouTube in Google Chrome, without having your attention stolen from you via short-form video. It is sickening that there is not already a setting in Youtube (or other media apps) to disable short-form videos.
